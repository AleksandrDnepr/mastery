                            t Bursted Wood Primary School,children in key stage
                            1 had already embarked on a secure mathematical
                            journey, putting algebra at the heart of the
                            curriculum. The demands of the 2014 National
                            Curriculum meant that in Year 1 children were
                            expected to be taught to use all four arithmetic
                            operations, and fractions, as operators. As a
                            result, Bursted Wood adopted a series of textbooks
                            written by Caleb Gattegno called Numbers in Colours.
                            These textbooks use Cuisenaire rods to encourage the
                            learner to explore patterns, and then to give letter
                            code names to the patterns, and record the
                            relationships between them with equations. It is
                            only after the letter code exploration that they
                            finally use a rod as a unit of measure (e.g. white
                            representing one), and transform their equations
                            into arithmetic. Very early on in Year 1, children
                            are able to read and write a variety of complex
                            algebraic

                            1. In Year 2 we wanted to take it a step further by
                            running computing lessons using the same use of
                            natural language and level of sophistication.

                        <h3>Why Haskell?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Haskell is closely aligned to conceptual mathematics
                            and number theory, the inspiration for Gattegno
                            Mathematics. It has four attributes that make it
                            particularly appropriate for mathematics education:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <span
                                    >Its syntax is very close to traditional
                                    mathematical notation (but beware that it
                                    can be too terse).</span
                                >
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span>
                                    Variables are statically typed, which means
                                    that programmers are protected by the
                                    compiler from passing invalid information as
                                    an argument (input) or output value.</span
                                >
                            </li>

                                    The Haskell interpreter evaluates functions
                                    ‘lazily’, only when required. This makes it
                                    possible to program infinite data structures
                                    in finite memory.</span

                                <span>
                                    Information is passed from the arguments to
                                    functions by pattern matching. This is an
                                    intuitive way for programmers to envisage
                                    and reason about the behaviour of their
                                    programs.</span

                        <h3>Starting with a staircase</h3>
                        <p>
                            To start, we went back to a familiar pattern that
                            Gattegno introduces in the textbooks, called a
                            staircase. This is built from one rod of each colour
                            arranged in size order (figure 1). The children were
                            able to physically build the staircase. However,
                            because they were so familiar with the pattern, they
                            could also access it virtually, which would help
                            with debugging and logical reasoning later. A
                            role-play game to establish computational thinking
                            was introduced before any actual programming began.
                            This allowed the children to familiarise themselves
                            with the function calls successor and predecessor
                            (succ, pred) while traversing the staircase. The
                            children would take turns to ask each other
                            questions such as succ White (answer Red) or pred
                            Orange(answer Blue). To help the children access the
                            new programming vocabulary, one child

                                    would take the role of the ‘engine’ and the
                                    other ‘interpreter’. This was extended to
                                    succ $ succ (successor of successor) which
                                    uses function composition $. Some children
                                    could creatively enjoy inventing functions
                                    such as succ $ succ $ succ White to test the
                                    technique. The children experimented by
                                    writing down their calls before building
                                    themselves a rod calculator in Haskell. The
                                    language soon became a natural part of
                                    lessons and meant that it was easy to
                                    progress to the next step.

                                    debugging and retyping. The children could
                                    spot bugs in the engine because they had
                                    already worked out the answer. The staircase
                                    was a familiar pattern, so they could
                                    predict what the output should be. Children
                                    were also able to edit the Colour data type
                                    to model odd or even staircases and test
                                    their functions to see what the effect would
                                    be on the derived successor function. A

                                    Very soon the children were able to
                                    construct their own rod calculator in
                                    Haskell, by first constructing the engine
                                    using the Colour data type. Then the
                                    children asked the same role-play questions,
                                    this time by typing the language into the
                                    interpreter window. It soon became apparent
                                    that errors in the engine meant that the
                                    interpreter would not

                                    White rather than the colour names. He
                                    becomes aware as he is speaking that the
                                    version of the succ function that works for
                                    a staircase with a step size White is
                                    distinct from the version of succ in an even
                                    staircase, and he corrects himself. It is
                                    clear to see that he has constructed an
                                    image of the staircase and is virtually
                                    traversing it.

                                To build the rod arithmetic calculator, the
                                pupil reuses the equations that they studied in
                                Year 1. Gattegno’s definitions lie in the
                                algebraic domain. Programming illustrates the
                                distinction between algebra and arithmetic.
                                Making this clear is crucial to investigating
                                the level of abstraction that the learner has
                                reached. The figure shows a rod arithmetic
                                calculator constructed after four terms of
                                Gattegno Mathematics. The values associated with
                                the rod code letters are modelled as constant
                                functions in Haskell. Nine equations are derived
                                from Gattegno’s equivalent expressions. The
                                tenth, which binds an integer value to the code
                                for White, shows the choice of measuring unit,
                                which fixes the values of the other codes.By
                                introducing Haskell to the children we have been
                                able to take the mathematics that the children
                                are familiar with and successfully and
                                creatively introduce programming functions. We
                                have been able to provide both the teacher and
                                child with a rich situation, allowing them to
                                think both mathematically and computationally.
                                It is exciting to think where our investigations
                                may lead us to next!
